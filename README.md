- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukmanlah
- 👀 I’m interested in InfoSec and generic development and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development (at the time of writing, I kinda got too rusty for it, left everything I've learned at campus)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hacking/jailbreaking my in-car headunit since it is locked down so tight by the manufacturer, whom decided to stop updating it without the courtesy of at least releasing the source codes, ugh.
- 📫 How to reach me? Twitter! @lukmanhakim_lah
